The coursework covers the fundamental building blocks of programming, structured across seven units. The files within this folder correspond to the concepts below:
Unit 1: Introduction to Algorithms and Programming

Understanding the nature of computer programs.
Developing and using algorithms (complete, unambiguous, deterministic, and finite sets of instructions) to solve problems.
Introduction to programming languages and the Java Development Kit (JDK).

Unit 2: Creating Your First Java Program

Writing and explaining a simple Java program.
Working with output and dialog boxes.
Saving, compiling, and debugging code using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

Unit 3: Calculations, Variables, and Assignments

Performing mathematical calculations and understanding operator precedence.
Declaring and using variables (temporary data storage) and assignment statements.
Creating interactive programs that accept user input.

Unit 4: Making Decisions

Implementing program flow control using decision structures.
Using Boolean expressions and relational operators (<, >, ==).
Utilizing the if...else structure and logical connectives (&&, ||) to make complex decisions.

Unit 5 & 6: Repetition and Advanced Loops

Studying the concept of loops (e.g., while, for) to perform repetitive tasks efficiently.
Writing nested loops and combining loops with decision structures to create complex programs.

Unit 7: Methods

Breaking down large programs into smaller, manageable, and reusable chunks using methods (functions).
Understanding and creating methods with parameters (inputs) and return types (outputs).
