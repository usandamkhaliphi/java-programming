The Folder is structured around seven key units, all designed to build proficiency in handling complex data and creating scalable software using Java.

1. Data Structures: Foundations and Management
This section deals with mechanisms for storing data, differentiating data from information, and establishing the need for effective data structures.

Unit 1: An Introduction to Data

Covers Abstract Data Types (ADTs), the difference between temporary (memory) and permanent (disk) storage, and the importance of correct data structure selection.

Unit 2: Arrays and Linked Lists
Introduces two fundamental data structures used to store, sort, and retrieve large datasets efficiently.

Unit 5: Stacks and Queues
Explores specialized data structures with distinct storage and retrieval behaviors, commonly used in real-world applications.

2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

This section transitions from procedural programming to building software using reusable, modular components.

Unit 3: Object-Oriented Programming (Introduction)

Introduces the core principles of OOP, including classes, objects, and methods.

Unit 4: Object-Oriented Programming (Advanced)

Expands on core concepts with advanced topics like inheritance, composition, and polymorphismâ€”essential for building large, maintainable software systems.

3. External Storage and Professional Issues

The final units explore how data persists outside of the program and introduce students to professional issues in the IT field.

Unit 6: Files

Covers techniques for storing data permanently using file handling, including sequential, direct, and indexed file organization methods.

Unit 7: Ethical and Professional Issues in Information Technology

Discusses social, ethical, and legal considerations for IT professionals in the workplace and society.
